# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model  
#**Project Description**  
This project is aimed at creating a Machine Learning Model to predict the churn of the Telco Company.By identifying key factors contributing to churn and building predictive models, the project seeks to help the company develop effective retention strategies.  

#**Data Collection**  
The Telco Customer Churn dataset was sourced from Kaggle, as a csv file of 176Kb.  
The Dataset is a collection of data for the Customers of the Telco who had churned within the last month of the data collection. The information of the customer includes:  
-Services the customer signed up for.e.g. Internet services, device protection, streaming services, technical support etc.  
-Customer account information. e.g. Contract period,payment method, monthly service charges, customer age in the company etc.
-Demographic information about customers. e.g. Age, gender etc.  

#**Data Processing**  
1.**_Handling Missing Values_**: Cleaning the data to ensure there are no missing values that could distort the analysis findings.  
2.**_Normalizing Numerical Data_**: Converted the numerical data in two columns ('**_MonthlyCharges_**' and '**_TotalCharges_**' to have them to 2 decimal places.  
3.**_Encoding Categorical Variables_**: Cleaned the data types of various variables by converting the data types to the correct data types. This ensures the data is in machine readable format.    
4.**_Feature Engineering_**:Preprocess raw data into machine-readable format
